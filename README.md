My macOS dotfiles.

## Installation

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/MrSmart00/dotfiles.git`
    - If your device doesn't install `CommandLineTools`, you should get error. Please install `CommandLineTools` beforehand.
        - Maybe your terminal offering install CommandLineTools, you would go through the flow or call `$ xcode-select --install`
3. `$ cd ~`
4. `$ ./dotfiles/initialize.sh`
